# Robust server structure: Static data practice
Your task is to build an API server for users and states. It should handle the following routes:

- /users returns an array of users in the form { data: Array }.
- /users/:userId returns a single user by id in form { data: {} } or User ID not found: ${userId} if the user doesn't exist.
- /states returns the states data in the form { data: {} }. E.g. ( data: { AL: 'Alabama', CT: 'Connecticut', DC: 'District of Columbia'}
)
- /states/:stateCode returns the states data in the form { data: { stateCode: String, name: String } } or State code not found: ${stateCode} if the state code doesn't exist.
- Any other path returns: Not found: ${req.originalUrl}

Use the existing data files located in src/data for the responses. Feel free to add or remove data from the files as necessary, but keep the same shape of the data.
